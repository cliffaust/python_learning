''' Immutable and mutable Objects '''

#immutable tuple

a = (2, 3)

# mutable string

# should throw an error
# a[0] = 1


b = [2, 3, 4]

b[1] = 10

# Value printed should be an updated version of the list
# print(b)


#immutable string

c = "Clifford"

# this should throw an error, since strings are immutable
# c[2] = "r"
